### Basic Info
Vitsy is a 1-D (forcedly so) stack-based language (WIP) that defines itself with basic stack functions (which I will be adding onto at a later time).
It executes lengthwise with an instruction pointer.

### Naming
Vitsy comes from a common shortening for my alias, VTC, pronounced as a word.

### VitsySafe
This jar file exists for servers with online interpreters. It is the 'safe mode' jar.

### Command Line Usage
You can either write a program to a file and run it from said file with `java -jar Vitsy.jar [--verbose] <filename> [arg 1] [arg 2] ...` or directly from the command line with `java -jar Vitsy.jar [--verbose] --code '<program>' [arg 1] [arg 2] ...`.
You can force values to be parsed as string input with `java -jar Vitsy.jar [--verbose] <filename | --code '<program>'> -v [num 1] [num 2] ...`.
Note that an empty program will print out the lyrics to 99 bottles of beer. c:

### Conversion
To convert a Vitsy program to/from verbose, add "--convert" to the command line arguments. Using "--verbose" will convert a verbose program to golfed, but the default (no extra flags) is the golfed to verbose.

### Wrap Nature
A program will only loop given that

- The last character on the line is a skip.
- The program is currently in any type of recursion (including if statements).
- The program is capturing a string.

### `;e` and `;u`
- When you declare `;e`, the text following `;ext` (with a space afterward) will be declared this class's superclass. This is important for use of the `K` command.
- When you declare `;u`, the text following `;use` (with a space afterward) will be declared as used by this class. This is important for use of the `k` command.
- Disabled in Safe mode.

Note that these can extend to the StackOverflow limit.

### Verbose Mode
- Verbose Mode is enabled through the command line with the `--verbose` flag.
- Basic Syntax:
   - Separate every command with a semicolon.
   - Separate every method index with a colon. (as you would separate every method in the golfed mode with a newline)
   - For details on individual commands, please see Converter.java

### Invalid Indexing
- Anything that is detected as causing a possible IndexOutOfBoundsException (or a subexception thereof) will be caught, with multiple filler 0s being pushed to the stack to compensate, then the operation continues.
   - An example of this is calling `-` on an empty stack: it will first detect that there is nothing to subtract from, and then push a zero, then detect that there is nothing subtracting, which pushes another 0, then carries out the subtraction, leaving 0 on the stack.

### Basic Syntax
 - input: `i`
    - push the top item of the input stack as an integer to the program stack
 - input length: `I`
    - push the length of the input stack to the top of the program stack
 - wait: `w`
    - wait the top item of stack in seconds.
 - ifnot: `)`
    - if the top item of the stack, post integer truncation, is not zero, do the next operation. Otherwise, skip it.
    - If an ifnot statement is found before a `[`, it will execute all information in `[...]` if and only if the top item is not zero. 
 - if: `(`
    - if the top item of the stack, post integer truncation, is equal to zero, do the next operation. Otherwise, skip it.
    - If an if statement is found before a `[`, it will execute all information in `[...]` if and only if the top item is zero. 
 - loop: `[`
    - begin a loop.
 - end loop: `]`
    - End a loop only if the top item of the stack is zero (and pop the zero). If this is called ouside of a loop it is treated as a NOP.
    - If the top item of the stack is not zero, return to the beginning of the loop (but do not pop the top value).
 - sine: `S`
    - Use the top value of the stack as input for a sine function, replacing said top value (in radians).
 - asine: `s`
    - Use the top value of the stack as input for an asine function, replacing said top value (in radians).
 - cosine: `C`
    - Use the top value of the stack as input for a cosine function, replacing said top value (in radians).
 - acosine: `A`
    - Use the top value of the stack as input for an acosine function, replacing said top value (in radians).
 - tangent: `T`
    - Use the top value of the stack as input for a tangent function, replacing said top value (in radians).
 - atangent: `t`
    - Use the top value of the stack as input for an atangent function, replacing said top value (in radians).
 - pi: `P`
    - Push a decimal approximation of pi to the top of the stack.
 - e: `E`
    - Push a decimal approximation of e to the top of the stack.
 - log: `L`
    - Take the log of the second-to-top item of the stack with a base of the top item of the stack.
 - outnum: `N`
    - Output the top number of the stack as a float.
 - outchar: `O`
    - Output the top number of the stack as a character (truncated first) with ISO-8859-1 encoding.
 - rand: `R`
    - Get a random number between 0 and the top item of the stack.
 - end: `;`
    - End execution of the current method or break out of a current while loop.
 - printall: `Z`
    - Print out the entire current stack as characters. Equivalent to `l\O`.
 - getall: `z`
    - Get all the input of the input stack and push it to the stack. Equivalent to `I\i`.
 - prompt: `W`
    - Get a line of STDIN. If there is no line input into the program, pause the program until another input line is input.
 - teleport: `#`
    - Teleport to the 1-D coordinates of the top item of the stack.
 - length: `l`
    - Get the length of the stack and push it to the top of the stack.
 - repeatnextchar: `\`
    - Repeat the next operation as many times as the truncated top item of the stack.
 - for loop: `\[` (relative to direction, if moving leftward, use `[\`)
    - Repeat the operations encapsulated in the `[...]` for the number of times specified by the top value of the stack.
 - reverse: `r`
    - Reverse the stack.
 - singswitch: `$`
    - Switch the top two items of the stack.
 - multiswitch: `%`
    - Rotate the top top items of the stack.
 - rotateright: `}`
    - Take the bottom item of the stack to the top.
 - rotateleft: `{`
    - Take the top item of the stack to the bottom.
 - duplicate: `D`
    - Duplicate the top item of the stack.
 - part: `@`
    - Get the top value of the stack's integer value and get its value's index, replacing the top value of the stack with said index.
 - rightstack: `?`
    - Shift one stack to the right - note that this will wrap around, so the 2-dimensionality of the stacks are... finicky.
 - leftstack: `|`
    - Shift one stack to the left. This will also wrap around.
 - clnstack: `:`
    - Clone the current stack, creating a new one and pushing all of the contents of the current stack to it. You will shift to this stack after this operation.
 - newstack: `&`
    - Create an empty stack.
 - rmstack: `Y`
    - Remove the current stack. This will shift you one stack to the right (if it exists).
 - numstack: `y`
    - Get the current number of stacks.
 - flatten: `u`
    - Push the contents of the top stack to the previous stack, removing the top stack in the process.
    - Note that if there is only one stack, it push the contents of itself to itself, then remove itself, acting like rmstack.
 - tempvar: `v`
    - If there is no value in tempvar, set the top item of the stack to it. Otherwise, push the tempvar value to the stack and clear the value of tempvar.
 - globalvar: `V`
    - If there is no value in globalvar, set the top item of the stack to it. Otherwise, push the globalvar value to the stack.

 - divide: `/`
    - Divide the top item of the stack by the second-to-top item of the stack.
 - equal: `=`
    - If the top two items of the stack are equal, chop off the top item of the stack and replace it with a zero.
    - If they are not equal, chop off the top item of the stack and replace it with a 1.
 - modulo: `M`
    - Modulo the top item of the stack by the second-to-top item of the stack.

 - power: `^`
    - Put the second-to-top item of the stack to the power of the top item of the stack.

    - If the top item of the stack is prime, push 1. Otherwise, push 0.
 - method: `m`
    - Go to the line in the source code file as defined by the truncated top item of the stack.
 - object: `o`
    - Push the current stack to an object referenced by the following character and remove it from the program stack. This will not override commands.
    - Once the aforementioned character is in the instruction pointer again, it will push the object's stack to the program stack.
    - Any character that is instantiated will draw the program's stack again if it has no object stack.
 - classmethod: `k`
    - Pop the top two items of the stack. Using the second-to-top item, get the index of the `;u` declaration and load that class. Then execute the top item line of code.
    - If the second to top item is -1, it will execute the specified line of code in the current program.
    - If the second to top item is -2, it will execute the specified line of code in the superclass.
    - Disabled in Safe mode.
 - super: `K`
    - Do the current line of code of the superclass (as defined in the `;e` declaration).
    - Disabled in Safe mode.
 - usecount: `g`
    - Count the amount of use declarations that are valid and push it to the stack.
    - Disabled in Safe mode.
 - classname: `G`
    - Get the name of the class as indexed by the top item of the stack.
    - If the reference index is -1, it will return the name of the current class.
    - If the reference index is -2, it will return the name of the superclass.
    - Disabled in Safe mode.
 - file: <code>\`</code>
    - Pop the entire current stack as a string and open the file with that string name, pushing its contents to the stack.
    - Disabled in Safe mode.
 - write: `.`
    - Pop the current stack and use that as a file name, then pop stack to the right and use that as contents of the file.
    - Disabled in Safe mode.
 - shell: `,`
    - Pop the current stack and use that as a command for use in the system terminal, then push the results of that terminal process to the current stack.
    - Disabled in Safe mode.
 - eval: `n`
    - Pop the current stack and evaluate the string equation, pushing the result to the current stack. If unevaluable, it will push NaN.
 - exitnow: `x`
    - Pop n, exits immediately with n status.
 - go left: `<`
    - Turn the instruction pointer to the left.
 - go right: `>`
    - Turn the instruction pointer to the right.
 - nothing:  
    - Anything undefined is a NOP.
 - quote: `"` or `'`
    - Double or single quotes begin to parse code as a string until encountering another quote.

### Future Updates
I plan to include indexing of a stack (picking a specific item), removing approximations of complex numbers (and making them symbolic), and any more suggested changes.
