## Esolangs Page

All information relating to Vitsy syntax, command line usage, data structures, and more can be found on the [esolangs page](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Vitsy). Please seek all information there.

### Future Updates
I plan to include indexing of a stack (picking a specific item), removing approximations of complex numbers (and making them symbolic), and any more suggested changes.
